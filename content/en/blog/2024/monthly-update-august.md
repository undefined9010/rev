# Monthly Update: August 2024

In August we made important updates to give our users better information about the risks of their token approvals and wallet security. We achieved this through our improved risk indicators and updated exploit checker. We are also working on improved educational content to give our users more information about wallet security.

## Risk Indicators

Earlier on in March of this year we partnered with ScamSniffer to provide risk indicators in the Revoke.cash Dashboard. This was a first step towards giving our users more information about the risks of their token approvals.

In August we've greatly expanded this feature through our partnership with [Webacy](https://webacy.com/) and our own risk engine. Through this integration and our own risk engine we are now able to provide a lot more risk indicators, such as known malicious contracts, risky contract code or old/deprecated contracts.

## Updated Exploit Checker

Since we released the exploit checker over a year ago, it has become one of our most popular features. But one common piece of feedback that we've received is that we only looked at the current state of the token approvals in the wallet, and not the history.

With the help of our newest open-source contributor [Chidozie David](https://github.com/Dozie2001) we've updated the exploit checker to also check the history of the token approvals in the wallet. That makes it easier for our users to understand if they were previously affected by the exploit, or if they steered clear of the exploited contract altogether.

## New Educational Content

In addition to these product updates, we've also been working on improving our educational content. One of the big challenges we face when crypto users get scammed is that they often don't know what they even did to get scammed. That is why we've created [a new guide](/learn/security/what-to-do-when-scammed) that goes over the most common scams that we see, how to diagnose them, how to recover from them and how to prevent them in the future.
