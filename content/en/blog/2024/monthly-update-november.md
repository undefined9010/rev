# Monthly Update: November 2024

In November the Revoke team attended Devcon 7, where we met up with a lot of our users and other people in the crypto space. We also launched our first merchandise, which we gave out at the event. Additionally we worked on improving a lot of our backend infrastructure.

## Revoke Team at Devcon & Merchandise

Devcon is the largest Ethereum event in the world, with 12,000 attendees from all over the world, so we could not miss the opportunity to attend. We met up with a lot of our users, friends (old and new), and a lot of other people in the crypto space.

At the event we also launched our first line of merchandise, which we gave out to out users at the event. It was very well received, and we're planning to create more high quality merchandise in the future.

## Improved Infrastructure

After the batch revoke update of last month, we noticed that we needed to improve some of our backend infrastructure and refactor parts of the codebase. This month we focused on improving our RPC reliability, improving our token spam filters, improving performance, and refactoring the codebase to make supporting new networks easier in the future.

## New Supported Networks

We've added a few more networks to our ever-growing list of 100+ supported networks.

New Mainnets:

- [Bitlayer](/token-approval-checker/bitlayer)
- [Shape](/token-approval-checker/shape)
- [Lisk](/token-approval-checker/lisk)
- [Geist](/token-approval-checker/geist)
- [ZERÏ´](/token-approval-checker/zero)

New Testnets:

- [Story Odyssey](/token-approval-checker/story-odyssey)
