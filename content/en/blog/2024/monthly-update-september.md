# Monthly Update: September 2024

September was mostly a month of work in progress. We have not yet been able to release the new functionality that we've been working on, but it is a big one, and something that many of our users have been asking for. We plan to bring it to you in October, so stay tuned!

While no new features were released, we've added one new network to our ever-growing list of 100+ supported networks.

New Testnet:

- [Morph Holesky](/token-approval-checker/morph-holesky)
