On March 20 2024, over $1.8m was stolen from users of an old version of DeFi protocol Dolomite. The exploit was found in an old contract that was deployed in 2019 and had since been discontinued. However, several users still had lingering approvals to this old contract, which the attacker was able to exploit to drain funds from their wallets.
