About $130k was stolen from users of crosschain DEX Magpie. The Magpie team released a post-mortem statement in which they pointed out that the attacker created an address that starts with one of the approved selectors, and exploited a bug where the position of the selector wasn't checked. The affected wallet addresses were reimbursed according to Magpie.
