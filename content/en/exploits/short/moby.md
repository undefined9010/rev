Close to $2.5m was stolen from DeFi platform Moby Trade and its users. The attacker was able to gain access to the protocol's admin keys, which they used to execute malicious upgrades on the protocol's contracts - allowing them to drain the wallets of any users that had active token approvals for the protocol. Close to $1.5m was recovered by the protocol's team and SEAL911, resulting in a loss of $1m for the users.
