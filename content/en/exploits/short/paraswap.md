On March 20th 2024, ParaSwap discovered a vulnerability in one of their smart contracts. After discovering this vulnerability, they executed a successful whitehat hack to rescue affected user funds. A few addresses were missed so about $24k of funds ended up being stolen. ParaSwap is working on refunding all affected users shortly.
