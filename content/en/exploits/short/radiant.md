Over $50m was stolen from Radiant Capital's Lending Pool contracts. In this exploit, malicious actors compromised the devices of several core team members and signers of Radiant Capital's multisig wallet. After compromising these devices, the attackers were able to make it seem like the signers were signing safe transactions, while they were actually transferring ownership of the multisig wallet to the attackers. Once the multisig was transferred, the attackers pushed an update to the Lending Pool contracts, draining all of the funds from the lending pools and approved user wallets.
